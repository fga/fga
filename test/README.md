# Tests

Tests to be run by the build system go here. That includes:

* PHPUnit/Simpletest tests to be run Drupal-internally
* Selenium tests to be run externally against the built Drupal instance
* RSpec/other system-level tests to be run against other services

Further subdivision into (at least) smoke tests and full test runs are
necessary.
